Welcome
=============

I always figure out the way feel more comfortable with my pront, because I spend a lot of time in this one, recently I came across with a post interesting that help me improve it.

You can check out [the article](http://stevelosh.com/blog/2010/02/my-extravagant-zsh-prompt/)

Usage
--------------

I assumed you know how work oh-my-zsh shell, any dout about this one please see [the documentation](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)

`$ wget  --no-check-certificate https://raw.github.com/deivinsontejeda/my-custom-zsh-theme/master/whatever.zsh-theme` 

After downloaded move this file into ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes 

set `ZSH_THEME` in ~/.zshrc to `whatever`

At last, reload your terminal run: `$ source ~/.zshrc`

Any recomendation?
