Always I can figure out the way to I feel me more comfortable with my pront, because I spend a lot of time, recently I came across with a post interesting that did help me improve my pront.

How to install?
--------------

I assumed that you know how work oh-my-zsh shell, any dout about this one please see [the documentation](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)

`~ wget https://raw.github.com/deivinsontejeda/my-custom-zsh-theme/master/whatever.zsh-theme --no-check-certificate` 

After downloaded move this file into ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes 

set `ZSH_THEME` in ~/.zshrc to `whatever`

At last, reload your terminal run: `~ source ~/.zshrc`

Any recomendation?
